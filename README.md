Project Title: Issues with Archiving and Interpretating Data
Presentaters: AJ Herget & Tina Liu

In this presentation, we delve into the popular discussions about big data and archive, hoping to investigate the nature of massive information and the related controversy. We use 6 acadamic articles to demonstrate how big data are transforming our life and how they create problems. Rethinking the construction and use of big data and archive allows us to reflect on the limitations of big data.

My part focuses on the topics of archives. Archival work is deemed as essential in any form of digital analysis. The number of archives and the amount of information currently stored in our archives are so tremendous that they meanwhile create us a strong sense of all-encompassing. The articles I have read shows that the big amount of data we now have allow us to analyze texts that are unanalyzable. Meanwhile, the amount of information we have still prove its own limit as it still embraces the enduring feature of traditional archives: they are selected by the authority and barely represent the wholeness as it claims to do. 

AJ and I chose to first research the topics we found interesting and then combined them when preparing the presentation. Although our topics do not match perfectly, we found they collectively present the complexity behind big data and provoke interesting questions about the topics.
